# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Analyze and improve the implementation of card pack purchasing functionality in a multiplayer card game server to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the project's grading rubric (barema).

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Java-based server-client architecture with TCP/UDP communication
- **Architecture**: Multithreaded server with one thread per client (`ClientHandler`), using `ConcurrentHashMap` and `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` for thread-safe data structures
- **Communication Protocol**: Text-based messages with format `COMMAND:PLAYER_ID:ARG1:ARG2...`
- **Key Components**:
  - `GameClient`: Handles user interaction and sends commands to server
  - `ClientHandler`: Processes client commands in separate threads
  - `GameFacade`: Main game logic coordinator
  - `StoreService`: Manages card pack purchases
  - `CardPackFactory`: Creates different types of card packs
- **Card Pack Types**: BASIC (100 coins, 5 basic cards), PREMIUM (500 coins, 3 rare + 2 basic), LEGENDARY (1500 coins, 1 legendary + 2 rare + 2 equipment/attribute)
- **Barema Requirements**: Card packs should function as a "global inventory", ensure fair distribution when multiple players open packs simultaneously, and prevent duplications or losses of cards

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the existing card pack purchase implementation in the codebase
- Extracted and reviewed requirements from the project's barema (grading rubric) including PDF documents and images
- Identified several incongruences between the implementation and barema requirements:
  - Lack of true randomness in card selection for premium/legendary packs
  - Absence of a global inventory system for cards
  - Insufficient feedback to clients about cards obtained
  - Generic error handling without specific failure reasons
  - No mechanisms to ensure fair distribution of rare cards among concurrent players

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze the barema and requirements for card pack purchases
2. [DONE] Examine the implementation of the store system and card pack purchases in the code
3. [DONE] Identify possible incongruences between the barema and implementation
4. [DONE] Analyze images and extract specific requirements from the barema
5. [DONE] Compare barema requirements with code implementation
6. [DONE] Identify specific incongruences between the barema and implementation
7. [TODO] Implement true randomness in card selection for premium/legendary packs
8. [TODO] Create a global inventory system for managing card availability
9. [TODO] Improve client feedback with detailed information about obtained cards
10. [TODO] Enhance error handling with specific failure messages
11. [TODO] Implement mechanisms for fair distribution of rare cards among concurrent players
